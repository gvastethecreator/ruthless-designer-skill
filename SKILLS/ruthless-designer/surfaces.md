# Surfaces

Surfaces carry hierarchy, touch targets, media edges, and state. Keep fixes tied to the surface job.

## Context

- Dense apps: clarity and scan speed. Borders are fine for grids, inputs, dividers, and focus states.
- Cards/media: depth and edge quality. Shadows-as-borders and image outlines usually help.
- Marketing/editorial: larger rhythm and hierarchy. Radii, shadows, and optical alignment can be more expressive.
- Design systems: prefer token fixes over one-off component overrides.
- Anti-slop: avoid nested cards, one-sided accent stripes, huge card radii, glass-by-default, and hairline border plus wide soft shadow unless the design system explicitly owns them.

## Functional Translucency

Treat translucent/blurred material as functional chrome, not a decoration. It can work for sticky nav, toolbars, sidebars, sheets, command surfaces, and overlays that float above real content. It is usually wrong for ordinary cards, feature tiles, pricing panels, or fake depth.

Use it only when all are true:

- The surface overlaps or floats above content that remains conceptually present.
- The blur/transparency improves hierarchy, spatial continuity, or the chosen signature move.
- Text on the material remains readable over busy and plain backgrounds.
- Larger surfaces use stronger separation than small chips; do not stack light translucent surfaces on light translucent surfaces.
- `prefers-reduced-transparency` or high-contrast mode can fall back to a solid or near-solid surface.

```css
.floating-toolbar {
  background: rgb(255 255 255 / 0.78);
  backdrop-filter: blur(18px) saturate(140%);
  box-shadow: 0 0 0 1px rgb(0 0 0 / 0.08), 0 10px 30px rgb(0 0 0 / 0.12);
}

@media (prefers-reduced-transparency: reduce), (prefers-contrast: more) {
  .floating-toolbar {
    background: rgb(255 255 255 / 0.98);
    backdrop-filter: none;
  }
}
```

Avoid hard dividers on floating chrome when the problem is overlap with scrolling content. A tiny fade, scrim, or shadow edge can read better than a permanent `1px` line, but verify it against real content.

## Concentric Border Radius

For tight nested rounded elements:

```text
outer radius = inner radius + padding
```

```css
/* Good: 12 + 8 */
.card {
  padding: 8px;
  border-radius: 20px;
}

.card-inner {
  border-radius: 12px;
}
```

```tsx
// Tailwind: 16px outer, 8px padding, 8px inner
<div className="rounded-2xl p-2">
  <div className="rounded-lg">...</div>
</div>
```

Skip strict math when:

- Padding/gap is large enough that the layers read as separate surfaces.
- The project uses intentional asymmetry.
- The inner item is not visually nested, such as a floating badge.

## Optical Alignment

Geometric centering is the starting point. Adjust optically when the shape looks off.

Buttons with text and icon:

```css
.button-with-icon {
  padding-left: 16px;
  padding-right: 14px;
}
```

Play triangles:

```css
.play-button svg {
  margin-left: 2px;
}
```

Asymmetric icons:

- Best: fix the SVG viewBox/path so every use benefits.
- Fallback: add a tiny margin/padding at the component boundary.
- Avoid: random per-instance nudges without a visible reason.

## Shadows Instead of Borders

Use shadows as borders when a border is trying to create depth on cards, buttons, popovers, media wrappers, or raised containers.

```css
:root {
  --shadow-border:
    0 0 0 1px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.06),
    0 1px 2px -1px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.06),
    0 2px 4px 0 rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.04);
  --shadow-border-hover:
    0 0 0 1px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.08),
    0 1px 2px -1px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.08),
    0 2px 4px 0 rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.06);
}

.card {
  box-shadow: var(--shadow-border);
  transition-property: box-shadow;
  transition-duration: 150ms;
  transition-timing-function: ease-out;
}

.card:hover {
  box-shadow: var(--shadow-border-hover);
}
```

Dark mode often needs only a subtle light ring:

```css
.dark {
  --shadow-border: 0 0 0 1px rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.08);
  --shadow-border-hover: 0 0 0 1px rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.13);
}
```

Keep real borders for:

- Input outlines and focus states.
- Dividers and table/list separators.
- Dense grid boundaries.
- Semantically flat surfaces where depth would lie.

Avoid pairing a visible `1px` border with a broad soft shadow on the same card or button. That pattern often creates a generic ghost card instead of a clear surface. Choose one job: defined edge, low-opacity structural border, or restrained elevation.

## 2px Low-Opacity Borders

In dense dark UIs, a `1px` border can disappear into black panels. Use a thicker neutral border at low opacity when the edge is part of the reading system.

```css
:root {
  --surface-border: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1);
  --surface-border-hover: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.16);
}

.panel,
.card,
.control {
  border: 2px solid var(--surface-border);
}

.panel:hover,
.control:hover {
  border-color: var(--surface-border-hover);
}
```

Light mode equivalent:

```css
:root {
  --surface-border: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);
}
```

Use it for:

- Structural panels, cards, tool surfaces, buttons, inputs, and popovers.
- Prototype shells where edges must read quickly against a black background.
- Surfaces whose border is the primary separation cue.

Keep `1px` for:

- Table rows, list separators, panel dividers, hairlines, and compact grids.
- Focus outlines, unless the existing design system already defines them.
- Media inset outlines, which should usually remain `1px` inside the image edge.

Avoid thick colored `border-left` or `border-right` accents on cards, list items, and callouts. If color needs to signal state, use a full-perimeter border, background tint, icon, label, or semantic state token.

Avoid `32px+` radii on cards, panels, and inputs. Pills can be fully rounded; structural surfaces should stay inside the local radius scale.

## Image and Media Outlines

Images often need a neutral inset edge so they do not bleed into the surface.

```css
.media {
  outline: 1px solid rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);
  outline-offset: -1px;
}

.dark .media {
  outline-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1);
}
```

Tailwind:

```tsx
<img className="outline outline-1 -outline-offset-1 outline-black/10 dark:outline-white/10" />
```

Rules:

- Light mode: neutral black at low opacity.
- Dark mode: neutral white at low opacity.
- Avoid palette-tinted outlines; they make image edges look dirty.
- Skip outlines on deliberately borderless/full-bleed media.

## Hit Areas

Target 44x44px. Use 40x40px as the floor in dense desktop UI.

```css
.small-control {
  position: relative;
  width: 20px;
  height: 20px;
}

.small-control::after {
  content: "";
  position: absolute;
  left: 50%;
  top: 50%;
  width: 40px;
  height: 40px;
  transform: translate(-50%, -50%);
}
```

Do not let expanded hit areas overlap. If controls are too close, increase spacing or shrink the pseudo-element to the largest non-overlapping target.

## Custom Scrollbars

Customize scrollbars only when the interface already has a strong surface system or the default scrollbar clashes with the shell. Keep the scrollbar visible and native; do not replace scrolling with JS.

```css
:root {
  --scrollbar-track: #050505;
  --scrollbar-thumb: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.16);
  --scrollbar-thumb-hover: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.24);
}

* {
  scrollbar-color: var(--scrollbar-thumb) var(--scrollbar-track);
  scrollbar-width: thin;
}

*::-webkit-scrollbar {
  width: 12px;
  height: 12px;
}

*::-webkit-scrollbar-track {
  background: var(--scrollbar-track);
}

*::-webkit-scrollbar-thumb {
  border: 2px solid var(--scrollbar-track);
  border-radius: 999px;
  background-color: var(--scrollbar-thumb);
  background-clip: padding-box;
}

*::-webkit-scrollbar-thumb:hover {
  background-color: var(--scrollbar-thumb-hover);
}
```

Rules:

- Match track/thumb colors to the surface tokens.
- Keep contrast subtle but discoverable.
- Use `scrollbar-gutter: stable` on important panels when layout shift would hurt scanning.
- Verify both desktop and mobile overflow states.

## Quick Audit

- Nested rounded surfaces: radius math or intentional exception.
- No cards inside cards unless the nested surface has a real interaction or containment job.
- No thick one-sided accent border unless it is a table/grid boundary, not decoration.
- No decorative glass or stripe backgrounds by default.
- Translucent material, if used, is functional chrome with reduced-transparency/contrast fallback.
- No hairline border plus broad shadow stack unless the design system documents it.
- Icon buttons: visual center, not only flex center.
- Media cards: neutral image edge.
- Raised surfaces: shadow-as-border where depth is the goal.
- Dense dark shell: `2px` low-opacity structural borders where `1px` is too weak.
- Scroll containers: custom scrollbar matches tokens and remains visible/native.
- Forms/tables: borders preserved where they carry structure.
- Touch targets: large enough and non-overlapping.
